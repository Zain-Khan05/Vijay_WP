        The Firefighting Robot is a compact and portable emergency responder robot that assists firemen in fighting high-rise fires, especially in highly dangerous environments where it is not safe for people to enter.
        
        Equipped with a thermal imager that is able to detect hot zones in a room autonomously without being impeded by smoke, the scenes captured by the robot’s camera are transmitted live to the operator’s control unit, allowing firefighters to assess the fire scene from a safe distance while remotely guiding the robot. With the flexibility to discharge foam from its 9-litre on-board foam solution tank or water through its water monitor, the Firefighting Robot can put out small yet potentially lethal fires in a confined space. Therefore, reducing risk exposure, alleviate cognitive loads and allow more bandwidth for firefighters during an emergency to conduct highly demanding tasks such as casualty rescue.
